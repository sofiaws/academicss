description: I'm a PhD student at the [NMR Kids Lab](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en/research/developmental_neuroscience.html) at the __University of ZÃ¼rich__. My project is about the intergenerational transfer of socioemotional skills. To address this topic, I use fMRI, behavioural questionnaires, physiological measures, and computational models. In my research, I support open science practices.
