description: I'm a PhD Candidate at the [NMR Kids Lab](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en/research/developmental_neuroscience.html) at the __University of Zurich__. I study how children develop socioemotional skills and how this process is associated with their families. For that, I use fMRI, behavioural questionnaires, physiological measures, and computational models. In my research, I support open science practices.
